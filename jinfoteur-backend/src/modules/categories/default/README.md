# TODO for default categories

These are called _default categories_ because they come created with the application with all their functionality already defined and tailored for each domain. Each of this categories would be equivalent to a "domain" of an ERP system (e.g: "sales", "products", "users", etc). They can have different UI/UX and functionalities based on the need of each category.

The following are the default categories:

## Secure categories (treated with more security measures than the rest)

* Business Management
* Financial Management
* Events Management

## Non Secure categories (these could be default or not, no need for security)

* Movement and Exercise
* Relaxation and Meditations
* Restaurants
* Foods and Supplements
* Technology (subcategories: PC / Mobile-cellphone / Gaming)
* Conferences (subcategories: Tech, Exercise, BUsiness, Self Improvement)
