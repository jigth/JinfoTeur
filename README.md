# JinfoTeur

Jinfoteur ("Jigth Informateur" or "Jigth Information System") is a system to manage information of different kinds in an efficient way, using Free Software and Open source technologies to do its different functionalities.

There are a lot of information systems out there but too often we use what has already been made for us, not questioning how does it work in practice, I think that the practice and practical results are the best way to learn about new topics and show something authentically, so this is a project to apply knowledge and technologies with some creativity.

If you want to contribute feel free to leave a Pull Request (prefferably with legible code and some little abstract on what does it do) or an Issue with your ideas for improvement (it doesn't have to be code to be useful).

Also this project is licensed as MIT so you are free to use it however you want without any guarantee or responsibility by my part. Clone it, fork it, modify it and learn by doing!

## General Description

The idea is to be able to upload and manage different kinds of digital content (multimedia files, images, video, text, etc) allowing for multiple visibility levels for them (private or public), expose that content through an API and some Frontend client (PWA or Web client).
